Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.42,0:09:16.94,Default,,0,0,0,,45. Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it devoured what they falsified.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.94,0:09:22.52,Default,,0,0,0,,46. So the magicians fell down in prostration [to God].
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.52,0:09:31.05,Default,,0,0,0,,47. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,

Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.89,0:10:06.73,Default,,0,0,0,,49. [Pharaoh] said, "You believed Moses before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic, but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all."
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.73,0:10:21.05,Default,,0,0,0,,50. They said, "No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.05,0:10:38.52,Default,,0,0,0,,51. Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers."
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.52,0:10:53.05,Default,,0,0,0,,52. And We inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued."
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.05,0:11:00.94,Default,,0,0,0,,53. Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.94,0:11:11.05,Default,,0,0,0,,54. [And said], "Indeed, those are but a small band,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:11.05,0:11:18.42,Default,,0,0,0,,55. And indeed, they are enraging us,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.42,0:11:24.94,Default,,0,0,0,,56. And indeed, we are a cautious society... "
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.94,0:11:33.47,Default,,0,0,0,,57. So We removed them from gardens and springs
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.47,0:11:39.89,Default,,0,0,0,,58. And treasures and honorable station -
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.89,0:11:48.63,Default,,0,0,0,,59. Thus. And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.63,0:11:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,60. So they pursued them at sunrise.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:54.00,0:12:09.05,Default,,0,0,0,,61. And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, "Indeed, we are to be overtaken!"
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.05,0:12:19.05,Default,,0,0,0,,62. [Moses] said, "No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me."
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.05,0:12:36.42,Default,,0,0,0,,63. Then We inspired to Moses, "Strike with your staff the sea," and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.42,0:12:43.57,Default,,0,0,0,,64. And We advanced thereto the pursuers.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.57,0:12:50.73,Default,,0,0,0,,65. And We saved Moses and those with him, all together.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:50.73,0:12:55.36,Default,,0,0,0,,66. Then We drowned the others.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.36,0:13:04.84,Default,,0,0,0,,67. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.84,0:13:11.36,Default,,0,0,0,,68. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.36,0:13:16.84,Default,,0,0,0,,69. And recite to them the news of Abraham,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.84,0:13:24.00,Default,,0,0,0,,70. When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?"
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.00,0:13:32.10,Default,,0,0,0,,71. They said, "We worship idols and remain to them devoted."
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.10,0:13:38.10,Default,,0,0,0,,72. He said, "Do they hear you when you supplicate?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.10,0:13:44.63,Default,,0,0,0,,73. Or do they benefit you, or do they harm?"
Dialogue: 0,0:13:44.63,0:13:55.05,Default,,0,0,0,,74. They said, "But we found our fathers doing thus."
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.05,0:14:02.84,Default,,0,0,0,,75. He said, "Then do you see what you have been worshipping,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:02.84,0:14:10.42,Default,,0,0,0,,76. You and your ancient forefathers?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.42,0:14:21.15,Default,,0,0,0,,77. Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:21.15,0:14:28.00,Default,,0,0,0,,78. Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:28.00,0:14:34.63,Default,,0,0,0,,79. And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.63,0:14:40.21,Default,,0,0,0,,80. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me
Dialogue: 0,0:14:40.21,0:14:46.94,Default,,0,0,0,,81. And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.94,0:14:58.52,Default,,0,0,0,,82. And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense."
Dialogue: 0,0:14:58.52,0:15:06.42,Default,,0,0,0,,83. [And he said], "My Lord, grant me authority and join me with the righteous.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.42,0:15:13.57,Default,,0,0,0,,84. And grant me a reputation of honor among later generations.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.57,0:15:22.42,Default,,0,0,0,,85. And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.42,0:15:33.36,Default,,0,0,0,,86. And forgive my father. Indeed, he has been of those astray.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:33.36,0:15:39.47,Default,,0,0,0,,87. And do not disgrace me on the Day they are [all] resurrected -
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.47,0:15:47.47,Default,,0,0,0,,88. The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.47,0:15:54.73,Default,,0,0,0,,89. But only one who comes to God with a sound heart."
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.73,0:16:01.68,Default,,0,0,0,,90. And Paradise will be brought near [that Day] to the righteous.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.68,0:16:08.52,Default,,0,0,0,,91. And Hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.52,0:16:13.89,Default,,0,0,0,,92. And it will be said to them, "Where are those you used to worship
Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.89,0:16:23.36,Default,,0,0,0,,93. Other than God? Can they help you or help themselves?"
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.36,0:16:29.36,Default,,0,0,0,,94. So they will be overturned into Hellfire, they and the deviators
Dialogue: 0,0:16:29.36,0:16:35.36,Default,,0,0,0,,95. And the soldiers of Iblees, all together.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.36,0:16:41.15,Default,,0,0,0,,96. They will say while they dispute therein,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.15,0:16:50.10,Default,,0,0,0,,97. "By God, we were indeed in manifest error
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.10,0:16:57.05,Default,,0,0,0,,98. When we equated you with the Lord of the worlds.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.05,0:17:05.47,Default,,0,0,0,,99. And no one misguided us except the criminals.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.47,0:17:09.05,Default,,0,0,0,,100. So now we have no intercessors
Dialogue: 0,0:17:09.05,0:17:13.99,Default,,0,0,0,,101. And not a devoted friend.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:13.99,0:17:26.52,Default,,0,0,0,,102. Then if we only had a return [to the world] and could be of the believers... "
Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.52,0:17:38.21,Default,,0,0,0,,103. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.21,0:17:48.21,Default,,0,0,0,,104. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:48.21,0:17:54.31,Default,,0,0,0,,105. The people of Noah denied the messengers
Dialogue: 0,0:17:54.31,0:18:01.68,Default,,0,0,0,,106. When their brother Noah said to them, "Will you not fear God?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:01.68,0:18:07.47,Default,,0,0,0,,107. Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:07.47,0:18:12.42,Default,,0,0,0,,108. So fear God and obey me.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.42,0:18:24.94,Default,,0,0,0,,109. And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:24.94,0:18:30.63,Default,,0,0,0,,110. So fear God and obey me."
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.63,0:18:38.94,Default,,0,0,0,,111. They said, "Should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest [class of people]?"
Dialogue: 0,0:18:38.94,0:18:45.57,Default,,0,0,0,,112. He said, "And what is my knowledge of what they used to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.57,0:18:52.73,Default,,0,0,0,,113. Their account is only upon my Lord, if you [could] perceive.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:52.73,0:18:59.26,Default,,0,0,0,,114. And I am not one to drive away the believers.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:59.26,0:19:04.94,Default,,0,0,0,,115. I am only a clear warner."
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.94,0:19:16.21,Default,,0,0,0,,116. They said, "If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be of those who are stoned."
Dialogue: 0,0:19:16.21,0:19:22.21,Default,,0,0,0,,117. He said, "My Lord, indeed my people have denied me.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:22.21,0:19:32.84,Default,,0,0,0,,118. Then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and those with me of the believers."
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.84,0:19:41.89,Default,,0,0,0,,119. So We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:41.89,0:19:48.94,Default,,0,0,0,,120. Then We drowned thereafter the remaining ones.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:48.94,0:19:59.15,Default,,0,0,0,,121. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.15,0:20:06.63,Default,,0,0,0,,122. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.

Dialogue: 0,0:20:41.47,0:20:48.73,Default,,0,0,0,,128. Do you construct on every elevation a sign, amusing yourselves,
