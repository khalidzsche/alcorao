Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.73,0:14:30.73,Default,,0,0,0,,58. And they who believe in the signs of their Lord
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.73,0:14:38.63,Default,,0,0,0,,59. And they who do not associate anything with their Lord
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.63,0:14:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,60. And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their Lord -

Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.57,0:16:37.15,Default,,0,0,0,,68. Then have they not reflected over the Qur'an, or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers?
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.15,0:16:45.26,Default,,0,0,0,,69. Or did they not know their Messenger, so they are toward him disacknowledging?

Dialogue: 0,0:18:46.00,0:19:00.94,Default,,0,0,0,,78. And it is He who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.94,0:19:09.05,Default,,0,0,0,,79. And it is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:09.05,0:19:23.89,Default,,0,0,0,,80. And it is He who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of the night and the day. Then will you not reason?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:23.89,0:19:30.52,Default,,0,0,0,,81. Rather, they say like what the former peoples said.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.52,0:19:43.78,Default,,0,0,0,,82. They said, "When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.78,0:20:02.10,Default,,0,0,0,,83. We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before; this is not but legends of the former peoples."
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.10,0:20:14.10,Default,,0,0,0,,84. Say, [O Muhammad], "To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?"
Dialogue: 0,0:20:14.10,0:20:25.36,Default,,0,0,0,,85. They will say, "To Allah." Say, "Then will you not remember?"

Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.68,0:21:20.84,Default,,0,0,0,,90. Rather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:20.84,0:21:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,91. Allah has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it created, and some of them would have sought to overcome others. Exalted is Allah above what they describe [concerning Him].
Dialogue: 0,0:21:48.00,0:21:59.57,Default,,0,0,0,,92. [He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He above what they associate [with Him].
Dialogue: 0,0:21:59.57,0:22:08.52,Default,,0,0,0,,93. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord, if You should show me that which they are promised,

Dialogue: 0,0:22:15.26,0:22:25.89,Default,,0,0,0,,95. And indeed, We are able to show you what We have promised them.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:25.89,0:22:36.42,Default,,0,0,0,,96. Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil. We are most knowing of what they describe.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:36.42,0:22:42.00,Default,,0,0,0,,97. And say, "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils,
Dialogue: 0,0:22:42.00,0:22:49.57,Default,,0,0,0,,98. And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me."
Dialogue: 0,0:22:49.68,0:23:01.78,Default,,0,0,0,,99. [For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back
Dialogue: 0,0:23:01.89,0:23:31.47,Default,,0,0,0,,100. That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind." No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.

Dialogue: 0,0:23:52.21,0:24:03.26,Default,,0,0,0,,102. And those whose scales are heavy [with good deeds] - it is they who are the successful.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:03.36,0:24:25.36,Default,,0,0,0,,103. But those whose scales are light - those are the ones who have lost their souls, [being] in Hell, abiding eternally.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:25.47,0:24:39.57,Default,,0,0,0,,104. The Fire will sear their faces, and they therein will have taut smiles.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:39.68,0:24:49.78,Default,,0,0,0,,105. [It will be said]. "Were not My verses recited to you and you used to deny them?"
Dialogue: 0,0:24:49.78,0:25:05.47,Default,,0,0,0,,106. They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:05.47,0:25:26.73,Default,,0,0,0,,107. Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return [to evil], we would indeed be wrongdoers."
Dialogue: 0,0:25:26.73,0:25:33.26,Default,,0,0,0,,108. He will say, "Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:33.26,0:26:00.94,Default,,0,0,0,,109. Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, 'Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the best of the merciful.'
Dialogue: 0,0:26:00.94,0:26:15.57,Default,,0,0,0,,110. But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:15.57,0:26:29.47,Default,,0,0,0,,111. Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for their patient endurance - that they are the attainers [of success]."
Dialogue: 0,0:26:29.57,0:26:34.63,Default,,0,0,0,,112. [Allah] will say, "How long did you remain on earth in number of years?"
Dialogue: 0,0:26:34.63,0:26:47.05,Default,,0,0,0,,113. They will say, "We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate."
Dialogue: 0,0:26:47.05,0:26:56.73,Default,,0,0,0,,114. He will say, "You stayed not but a little - if only you had known.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:56.73,0:27:18.42,Default,,0,0,0,,115. Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"
Dialogue: 0,0:27:18.42,0:27:40.31,Default,,0,0,0,,116. So exalted is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne.
